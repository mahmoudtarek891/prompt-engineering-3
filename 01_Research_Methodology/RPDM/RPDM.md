# Research Paper Development Methodology (RPDM)

## Project: prompt-engineering-3

## Overview
This document defines the research methodology for claim verification and traceability.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Establish core claims
- Define verification criteria
- Set up claim registry

### Phase 2: Verification
- Implement WVCV loops
- Document evidence
- Track claim status

### Phase 3: Synthesis
- Aggregate findings
- Validate conclusions
- Generate reports

## WVCV Loop Structure
1. **Write**: Document initial claim
2. **Verify**: Test against evidence
3. **Correct**: Update based on findings
4. **Validate**: Confirm final state
